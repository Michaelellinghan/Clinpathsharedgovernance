The IPF% is a direct measure of thrombopoiesis and is crucial for diagnosing the cause of thrombocytopenia.

                            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">This is a clever "double-check" that the machine runs automatically only if it spots something suspicious in the main white cell test (the WDF). It uses a different set of chemicals that affect normal and abnormal cells differently. This helps to confirm if there are genuinely worrying cells, like leukaemic blasts, or if the initial flag was just a false alarm. This saves a lot of time and helps scientists focus on the samples that really need a closer look under the microscope.</p>
