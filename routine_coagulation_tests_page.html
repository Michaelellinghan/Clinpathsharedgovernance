            <p class="text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center mb-8">These tests are our first-line investigations into the clotting system. They provide a quick and effective overview, helping doctors to monitor medication, prepare patients for surgery, and decide if more specialist testing is needed.</p>

                    <p>The PT measures how long it takes for a clot to form in a blood sample. It specifically assesses the 'extrinsic' and common pathways of the clotting cascade. Its most frequent use is to calculate the <strong>International Normalised Ratio (INR)</strong>, which is essential for monitoring patients on Warfarin therapy to ensure their blood is appropriately thinned.</p>

                    <p>The APTT measures the 'intrinsic' and common pathways of the cascade. It is commonly used as a pre-operative screen to check for underlying bleeding tendencies and for monitoring patients on Heparin therapy. An unexpectedly prolonged APTT would trigger further investigation into specific clotting factor deficiencies, like Haemophilia.</p>

                    <p>Fibrinogen is a key protein (Factor I) that is converted into fibrin threads to form the structure of a blood clot. We measure the level of fibrinogen in the blood, which is particularly important in cases of major bleeding or a condition called Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), where the clotting system becomes overactive and uses up all the fibrinogen.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2"><i class="fas fa-search-plus text-red-600 mr-2"></i>D-Dimer</h3>
                    <p>When a blood clot is broken down by the body, tiny protein fragments called D-Dimers are released. A normal D-Dimer level is very useful for helping to <strong>rule out</strong> the presence of a dangerous clot, such as a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the leg or a Pulmonary Embolus (PE) in the lungs. However, a high level can be caused by many other conditions, so it is less useful for confirming a clot.</p>
