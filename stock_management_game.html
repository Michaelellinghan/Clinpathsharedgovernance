Which do you issue?", choices: [ { text: "Issue the unit expiring in 5 days.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. Fresher units should be used for surgical cover in case they are returned unused." }, { text: "Issue the unit expiring in 25 days.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct! Fresher units are best for surgical cover, preserving short-dated stock for patients who will definitely be transfused." } ] },
                { description: "A porter returns a unit of O Negative blood from the ward. The paperwork shows it has been out of controlled temperature storage for 45 minutes. What do you do?", choices: [ { text: "Return it to the main stock fridge.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. The 30-minute rule has been breached; the unit cannot be returned to stock." }, { text: "Waste the unit, citing a cold chain failure.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct. Once a unit is out of the fridge for over 30 minutes, it cannot be returned to stock for another patient." } ] },
                { description: "It's the morning check. You notice a unit of platelets will expire in 24 hours. Your hospital has no patients who need it, but the other hospital site is low on platelet stock. What is the best course of action?", choices: [ { text: "Keep it, just in case someone needs it.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. It's likely to expire, and another hospital has a need. This would lead to wastage." }, { text: "Arrange to transfer the platelet to the other site.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct! Transferring short-dated stock to a site with higher usage is a key strategy to prevent wastage." } ] },

Which do you select?", choices: [ { text: "Select a non-irradiated unit; it's the same blood group.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. Failing to provide a specially required component is a serious error." }, { text: "Select an irradiated unit.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct. Special requirements for patients must always be met." } ] },

Which do you choose?", choices: [ { text: "Issue the unit expiring in 30 days.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. A top-up transfusion will definitely be given, so this is the perfect opportunity to use the shorter-dated unit." }, { text: "Issue the unit expiring in 3 days.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct! Using the oldest stock first for guaranteed transfusions is the best way to prevent wastage." } ] },

What do you do?", choices: [ { text: "Accept the delivery and update the stock.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. Accepting an incorrect delivery can lead to serious stock errors." }, { text: "Do not accept the delivery and contact NHSBT immediately.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct! Discrepancies must be resolved with the supplier before stock is accepted." } ] },

What should you do?", choices: [ { text: "Tell them you have no stock.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. While true, you must take action to source the required blood." }, { text: "Place an urgent/emergency order with NHSBT.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct! For rare blood types not held in routine stock, an urgent order must be placed." } ] },
                { description: "At 7am, you perform the 'taking back' procedure. A unit of blood issued for a patient yesterday was not used. What do you do?", choices: [ { text: "Leave it in the issue fridge, as it might be used today.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. Unused units must be processed correctly to maintain the audit trail." }, { text: "Return the unit to stock on the computer system and move it to the main fridge.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct! This ensures the unit is available for other patients and traceability is maintained." } ] },

What must you do?", choices: [ { text: "Clean it up and hope no one noticed.", correct: false, feedback: "Incorrect. All wastage must be documented for traceability." }, { text: "Record the unit as wasted due to damage on the computer system and dispose of it correctly.", correct: true, feedback: "Correct!
