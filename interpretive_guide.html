Common causes include myelofibrosis, metastatic cancer infiltrating the marrow, severe haemolysis, or overwhelming infection (sepsis).', nextSteps: 'This is a significant finding requiring urgent clinical correlation. Review previous haematology results. A bone marrow biopsy is often indicated to determine the underlying cause. Refer to haematology for review.' },
                    { term: 'Atypical Lymphocytes Seen', meaning: 'Large, reactive lymphocytes are present. These are activated lymphocytes responding to an infection.', causes: 'Most commonly caused by viral infections, classically infectious mononucleosis (Glandular Fever) due to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Also seen in Cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and other viral illnesses.', nextSteps: 'Suggest Monospot test (if appropriate for age/history) and viral serology. Clinical correlation with patient symptoms (fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy) is key.' },
                    { term: 'Rouleaux Formation', meaning: 'Red blood cells are arranged in stacks, like coins. This should be distinguished from red cell agglutination.', causes: 'Caused by high levels of plasma proteins, particularly immunoglobulins or fibrinogen, which reduce the negative charge on red cells. Strongly associated with Multiple Myeloma, but also seen in chronic inflammation, infection, and some cancers.', nextSteps: 'Recommend serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and ESR to investigate for a paraprotein. Check for signs of inflammation (e.g., CRP).' },
                    { term: 'Pancytopenia', meaning: 'A reduction in all major blood cell lineages: red cells (anaemia), white cells (leukopenia), and platelets (thrombocytopenia).', causes: 'A serious finding with a wide range of causes, including bone marrow failure (e.g., Aplastic Anaemia), haematological malignancy (e.g., Acute Leukaemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome), severe B12/Folate deficiency, or sequestration of cells in an enlarged spleen (hypersplenism).', nextSteps: 'Urgent referral to haematology for further investigation.

                    { term: 'Howell-Jolly Bodies (@HJ)', meaning: 'Small, round, dense nuclear remnants within red blood cells.', causes: 'These are normally removed by the spleen. Their presence is a key indicator of a non-functioning spleen (hyposplenism) or a previous splenectomy.', nextSteps: 'Confirm patient\'s splenic status. If spleen is present, this finding suggests it is not working correctly (e.g., due to sickle cell disease or coeliac disease).' },
                    { term: 'Red Cell Agglutination (@RCA2)', meaning: 'Irregular clumping of red blood cells, distinct from rouleaux.', causes: 'Usually caused by cold-reacting IgM antibodies (cold agglutinins). Can be associated with Mycoplasma infection, lymphoma, or be idiopathic.', nextSteps: 'Warm the sample to 37°C and re-analyse. If agglutination persists, it is difficult to obtain an accurate FBC. A blood film is essential.' }
