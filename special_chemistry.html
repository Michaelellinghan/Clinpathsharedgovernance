                <p>Special chemistry is the area of the laboratory where we perform the more complex and specialised tests. These tests often require specialised equipment and highly skilled staff, and they are used to diagnose and monitor a wide range of conditions that are not covered by routine chemistry tests.</p>
                <p>Some of the techniques we use in special chemistry include electrophoresis, which separates proteins based on their size and electrical charge, and chromatography, which separates different components of a mixture. These techniques allow us to identify and measure a wide range of substances in the blood and other body fluids.</p>
                <p>Some of the tests we perform in special chemistry include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Protein Electrophoresis:</strong> To detect abnormal proteins in the blood, which can be a sign of certain types of cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):</strong> To monitor long-term glucose control in people with diabetes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trace Metals:</strong> To measure the levels of essential and toxic metals in the body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Newborn Screening:</strong> To test newborn babies for a range of rare but serious conditions.</li>
