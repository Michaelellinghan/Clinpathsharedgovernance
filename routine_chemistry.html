                <p>Routine chemistry is the powerhouse of the clinical laboratory, performing a wide range of tests that provide a snapshot of a patient's overall health. These tests measure the levels of various substances in the blood, such as electrolytes (like sodium and potassium), glucose (sugar), and waste products (like urea and creatinine).</p>
                <p>We use highly automated analysers that can process hundreds of samples every hour, ensuring that doctors get the results they need quickly and accurately. These tests are essential for diagnosing and monitoring a wide range of conditions, from diabetes and kidney disease to dehydration and heart problems.</p>
                <p>Some of the most common tests we perform in routine chemistry include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Urea and Electrolytes (U&Es):</strong> To check kidney function and electrolyte balance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liver Function Tests (LFTs):</strong> To assess the health of the liver.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glucose:</strong> To diagnose and monitor diabetes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lipid Profile:</strong> To check cholesterol levels and assess the risk of heart disease.</li>
