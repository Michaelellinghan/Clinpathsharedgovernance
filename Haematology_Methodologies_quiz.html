                // Question 1: Routine Automation Principle
                { id: 1, correct: 'C', title: 'Which fundamental technology is utilized in automated haematology analyzers (e.g., the Sysmex XN-Series) for the enumeration of red blood cells (RBC) and platelets (PLT)?',
                  options: { A: 'Spectrophotometry (SLS Haemoglobin Method)', B: 'Fluorescence Flow Cytometry (FFC)', C: 'Sheath Flow (DC) Detection', D: 'Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA)' },
                  clue: 'This principle relies on measuring cell volume as the cells pass through an aperture, often using hydrodynamic focusing to ensure cells pass singly.',
                  explanation: '<p><strong>Correct Answer: C. Sheath Flow (DC) Detection.</strong></p><p><strong>Why C is correct:</strong> The XN-Series analyzers use three primary analysis principles, one of which is <strong>Sheath Flow (DC) Detection</strong> for performing the RBC and PLT analysis (counting and sizing). This method relies on the impedance change as cells pass through an electrical field.</p><p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Spectrophotometry, specifically the SLS Haemoglobin Method, is used exclusively for the cyanide-free analysis of <strong>Haemoglobin (HGB)</strong> concentration, not for counting RBCs or PLTs.</p><p><strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> Fluorescence Flow Cytometry (FFC) uses a laser to interrogate individual cells, often stained with a fluorescent dye, and is primarily used for <strong>White Blood Cell (WBC) differentials, reticulocytes (RET), and fluorescent platelet counts (PLT-F)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) is an <em>ex vivo</em> test used for detailed investigation of <strong>platelet function</strong>, assessing how platelets clump in response to agonists, and is not a core principle of routine FBC automation.</p>' },
                
                // Question 2: Specialized Coagulation Testing (TTP)
                { id: 2, correct: 'B', title: 'Diagnosis and management of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) in designated UK regional centres, as guided by the British Society for Haematology (BSH), relies on specialized assays that typically measure the activity of which critical enzyme?',
                  options: { A: 'Thrombin', B: 'ADAMTS13', C: 'Myeloperoxidase (MPO)', D: 'Prothrombin' },
                  clue: 'This enzyme assay can be measured using ELISA-based methods or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRETS) and is key to distinguishing TTP from other Thrombotic Microangiopathies (TMAs).',
                  explanation: '<p><strong>Correct Answer: B. ADAMTS13.</strong></p><p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> TTP is managed in designated regional centres in England as per NHSE commissioning. The diagnosis relies on specialized <strong>ADAMTS13 assays</strong>, which measure activity, antigen, and autoantibodies. Activity assays use full-length or synthetic VWF substrates, determining cleavage products via <strong>ELISA-based methods</strong> or <strong>FRETS</strong>.</p><p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Thrombin (Factor IIa) is a central enzyme in the common coagulation pathway. The Thrombin Time (TT) test measures the time for plasma to clot after adding thrombin, reflecting fibrinogen function, but is a screening test, not the specific diagnostic assay for TTP.</p><p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a cytochemical stain found in the primary granules of myeloid cells. MPO staining is used in the <strong>cytochemical investigation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</strong> to delineate the granulocytic lineage, but it has no role in TTP diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Prothrombin (Factor II) is assessed indirectly by the Prothrombin Time (PT) test, which measures the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways. While PT is a routine coagulation screen, it is not the specialist assay for TTP.</p>' },

                // Question 3: Specialist Red Cell Investigation (Hemoglobinopathy)
                { id: 3, correct: 'B', title: 'Which automated technique has largely replaced cellulose acetate electrophoresis for the identification and quantitation of abnormal haemoglobins (Hb variants and thalassaemias)?',

                  clue: 'This automated technique involves introducing a blood sample (haemolysate) into a column packed with silica gel, followed by elution by changing the pH and ionic strength of the buffer.',
                  explanation: '<p><strong>Correct Answer: B. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).</strong></p><p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> <strong>HPLC</strong> is an automated technique where haemoglobin fractions are adsorbed onto a resin in a column and selectively eluted using specific buffer conditions, providing detection and quantitation of different haemoglobins. Haemoglobin electrophoresis, while a basic technique, <strong>has been largely replaced by HPLC analysis</strong>.</p><p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Southern blot analysis is a molecular technique used to detect large <strong>gene deletions</strong> (e.g., in most alpha thalassaemias) or mutations that alter restriction enzyme recognition sites, using radioactive complimentary DNA probes. It analyzes DNA structure, not the haemoglobin protein fractions themselves.</p><p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Reticulocyte count (which can be measured by automated analysis) is a screening test used to assess the rate of red cell production (erythropoiesis) and is one of the initial tests to identify haemolysis, but it does not identify specific haemoglobin variants.</p><p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> The single tube osmotic fragility test is a routine screening method for assessing red cell resistance to haemolysis, characteristic of thalassaemia traits (where red cells are more resistant), and is often used in smaller routine laboratories lacking automated analyzers. It is not a method for identifying abnormal haemoglobin types (HbS, HbC, etc.).</p>' },
                
                // Question 4: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Detection
                { id: 4, correct: 'D', title: 'In the monitoring of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) following chemotherapy for acute leukemias, which molecular technique provides the necessary high sensitivity (detecting leukemic cells at a level of 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup>)?',
                  options: { A: 'Conventional Morphology (Romanowsky stain)', B: 'Immunophenotyping by Flow Cytometry', C: 'Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping)', D: 'Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based techniques (e.g., RT-PCR)' },
                  clue: 'This technique amplifies specific target sequences (like unique gene rearrangements or fusion products such as BCR-ABL) and is critical for risk stratification and individualized treatment plans post-remission induction.',
                  explanation: '<p><strong>Correct Answer: D. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based techniques (e.g., RT-PCR).</strong></p><p><strong>Why D is correct:</strong> <strong>PCR-based techniques (including RT-PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR)</strong> are highly sensitive, capable of detecting MRD at a level of <strong>10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup></strong> (1 leukemic cell in 10,000–100,000 healthy cells). This sensitivity allows for assessment of initial response, prognosis, and risk categorization, enabling further individualized treatment.</p><p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Conventional Morphology, using Romanowsky-stained smears, defines complete remission (CR) as the presence of less than 5% blast cells in the marrow. This method is considered <strong>conventional</strong> and cannot detect the submicroscopic persistence of disease that leads to relapse.</p><p><strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> Immunophenotyping by Flow Cytometry is used for MRD detection, particularly involving the enumeration of aberrant cell surface markers. However, while crucial for diagnosis, its practical limit of detection for MRD is typically lower (less sensitive) than highly optimized PCR methods, especially when needing to reach the 10<sup>-5</sup> level.</p><p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping) examines chromosomal structure and is essential for diagnosis and prognosis determination in acute leukemia. While it can detect large chromosomal abnormalities, its sensitivity is far too low for measuring residual disease at the micro-level required for MRD monitoring.</p>' },

                // Question 5: Blood Film Analysis Methodology
                { id: 5, correct: 'B', title: 'Which statement accurately describes the modern role and limitations of Digital Morphology (DM) analyzers in a routine UK haematology laboratory setting?',
                  options: { A: 'DM analyzers have completely replaced microscopic examination, serving as the new gold standard for complex peripheral blood smear reviews.', B: 'DM analyzers rely heavily on AI/ML to pre-classify cells and standardize analysis, but their accuracy can be compromised by poor quality blood films.', C: 'DM analyzers are currently the gold standard technology for differential cell counts in bone marrow aspirates, offering superior diagnostic reliability over manual counting.', D: 'Automated wedge smear preparation eliminates all artifacts, ensuring perfect DM analyzer performance.' },
                  clue: 'This technology assists laboratory technologists but expert review remains necessary for complex cases with atypical cells, and they are less effective when analyzing non-peripheral blood specimens.',
                  explanation: '<p><strong>Correct Answer: B. DM analyzers rely heavily on AI/ML to pre-classify cells and standardize analysis, but their accuracy can be compromised by poor quality blood films.</strong></p><p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> DM analyzers use digital imaging and AI/Machine Learning (ML) to pre-classify cells and enhance efficiency and standardization. However, the quality of the blood film and staining techniques <strong>significantly influence the accuracy</strong> of DM analyzers, and poor-quality samples may lead to errors. An expert review remains essential for complex cases.</p><p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> DM analyzers complement the traditional microscopic examination, but the latter is still considered the <strong>gold standard</strong>. DM analyzers have not yet replaced manual review entirely, especially in complex cases, due to algorithmic variability in recognizing rare or dysplastic cells.</p><p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> DM analyzers for <strong>Bone Marrow (BM) aspirate</strong> assessment have yet to be widely adopted, and they are currently <strong>less effective</strong> for BM aspirate examination due to higher complexity and lack of standardized sample preparation compared with Peripheral Blood (PB) smears. The manual BM examination remains the gold standard for investigating many hematological diseases.</p><p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Automated wedge smear preparation methods may generate artifacts due to mechanical trauma to cells (e.g., hypo-granularity of neutrophils or pseudopods on lymphocytes), and these artifacts can mimic the morphological manifestations of dysplasia (Myelodysplastic Syndrome), thus influencing DM analyzer performance negatively.</p>' },

                // Question 6
                { id: 6, correct: 'B', title: 'What automated technique is commonly used for the detection, identification, and quantification of haemoglobin variants (haemoglobinopathies and thalassaemias), having largely replaced traditional cellulose acetate electrophoresis in the modern laboratory?',
                  options: { A: 'Electrophoresis at Acidic pH (Citrate Agar)', B: 'High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)', C: "Acid Elution Test (Betke's method)", D: 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)' },
                  clue: 'This technique is automated and involves separating haemoglobin fractions by adsorbing them onto a silica gel column, followed by elution by precisely changing the pH and ionic strength of the buffer.',
                  explanation: '<p><strong>Correct Answer: B. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).</strong></p><p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> <strong>HPLC</strong> is an automated technique where haemoglobins are adsorbed onto a column matrix and eluted by altering pH and ionic strength. This method is highly suited for neonatal screening and has <strong>largely replaced haemoglobin electrophoresis</strong> for the identification and quantification of haemoglobin variants and HbA2/HbF levels.</p><p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Citrate agar electrophoresis at acid pH (6.0) is a secondary procedure, useful for <strong>further characterisation</strong> of variants (like HbS, HbD, HbG, HbC, HbE) that have identical migration on cellulose acetate electrophoresis at alkaline pH.</p><p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> The Acid Elution Test (Kleihauer-Betke test) assesses the cellular distribution of HbF. The Betke method (alkali denaturation test) is used to <strong>quantitate HbF</strong> levels (typically 2-40%).</p><p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> <strong>SDS-PAGE</strong> is used to analyze red cell membrane proteins (e.g., Spectrin, Ankyrin, Band 3) to identify the underlying defective protein in red cell membrane disorders like Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS).</p>' },
                
                // Question 7
                { id: 7, correct: 'B', title: 'For the highly sensitive monitoring of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and therapeutic response to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) in Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), which technique is used to quantify the ratio of BCR-ABL1 transcripts?',
                  options: { A: 'Conventional G-Banding Cytogenetics (Karyotyping)', B: 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)', C: 'Immunophenotyping by Flow Cytometry (FACS)', D: 'Microscopic Examination of Marrow Films' },
                  clue: 'This assay detects mRNA transcripts and is sensitive enough to measure residual disease at a level of 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup>. Molecular response (e.g., MMR) is typically defined by a reduction in this ratio, standardized using the International Standard (IS).',
                  explanation: '<p><strong>Correct Answer: B. Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR).</strong></p><p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> <strong>RT-PCR</strong> (specifically quantitative PCR or <strong>qPCR</strong>) is one of the two most sensitive diagnostic tests for CML and is the primary technique used to monitor response to TKI therapy by measuring the BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcript numbers. Response criteria, such as Major Molecular Response (MMR), are defined by the BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio.</p><p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Conventional cytogenetics detects the <strong>Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome</strong> in metaphase preparations and is essential for diagnosis. However, RT-PCR is <strong>more sensitive</strong> for detecting the fusion gene and monitoring MRD, especially after a Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) has been achieved.</p><p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Flow Cytometric Immunophenotyping (FACS) is used to detect MRD based on <strong>leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes</strong>. While useful, PCR-based techniques are generally cited as providing equal or greater sensitivity for MRD detection, reaching 10<sup>-5</sup> sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Microscopic examination (morphology) can define complete remission as &lt;5% blast cells, but it is a conventional method and cannot detect the <strong>submicroscopic persistence of disease</strong> required for effective MRD monitoring.</p>' },
