            <div class="clue" id="clue-1">
                <strong>Clue:</strong> This principle relies on measuring cell volume as the cells pass through an aperture, often using hydrodynamic focusing to ensure cells pass singly [1, 2].
            </div>
            <div class="explanation" id="explanation-1">
                <strong>Correct Answer: C. Sheath Flow (DC) Detection [2].</strong>
                <p><strong>Why C is correct:</strong> The XN-Series analyzers use three primary analysis principles, one of which is **Sheath Flow (DC) Detection** for performing the RBC and PLT analysis (counting and sizing) [2, 3]. This method relies on the impedance change as cells pass through an electrical field [1].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Spectrophotometry, specifically the SLS Haemoglobin Method, is used exclusively for the cyanide-free analysis of **Haemoglobin (HGB)** concentration, not for counting RBCs or PLTs [2, 4].</p>
                <p><strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> Fluorescence Flow Cytometry (FFC) uses a laser to interrogate individual cells, often stained with a fluorescent dye, and is primarily used for **White Blood Cell (WBC) differentials, reticulocytes (RET), and fluorescent platelet counts (PLT-F)** [3-5].</p>
                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) is an *ex vivo* test used for detailed investigation of **platelet function**, assessing how platelets clump in response to agonists, and is not a core principle of routine FBC automation [6].</p>

            <div class="clue" id="clue-2">
                <strong>Clue:</strong> This enzyme assay can be measured using ELISA-based methods or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRETS) and is key to distinguishing TTP from other Thrombotic Microangiopathies (TMAs) [7-9].
            </div>
            <div class="explanation" id="explanation-2">
                <strong>Correct Answer: B. ADAMTS13 [7].</strong>
                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> TTP is managed in designated regional centres in England as per NHSE commissioning [10]. The diagnosis relies on specialized **ADAMTS13 assays**, which measure activity, antigen, and autoantibodies. Activity assays use full-length or synthetic VWF substrates, determining cleavage products via **ELISA-based methods** or **FRETS** [7].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Thrombin (Factor IIa) is a central enzyme in the common coagulation pathway [11]. The Thrombin Time (TT) test measures the time for plasma to clot after adding thrombin, reflecting fibrinogen function, but is a screening test, not the specific diagnostic assay for TTP [12, 13].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a cytochemical stain found in the primary granules of myeloid cells. MPO staining is used in the **cytochemical investigation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** to delineate the granulocytic lineage, but it has no role in TTP diagnosis [14-16].</p>
                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Prothrombin (Factor II) is assessed indirectly by the Prothrombin Time (PT) test, which measures the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways. While PT is a routine coagulation screen, it is not the specialist assay for TTP [12, 13].</p>

            <div class="clue" id="clue-3">
                <strong>Clue:</strong> This automated technique involves introducing a blood sample (haemolysate) into a column packed with silica gel, followed by elution by changing the pH and ionic strength of the buffer [17-19].
            </div>
            <div class="explanation" id="explanation-3">
                <strong>Correct Answer: B. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) [17-20].</strong>
                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> **HPLC** is an automated technique where haemoglobin fractions are adsorbed onto a resin in a column and selectively eluted using specific buffer conditions, providing detection and quantitation of different haemoglobins. Haemoglobin electrophoresis, while a basic technique, **has been largely replaced by HPLC analysis** [17, 19].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Southern blot analysis is a molecular technique used to detect large **gene deletions** (e.g., in most alpha thalassaemias) or mutations that alter restriction enzyme recognition sites, using radioactive complimentary DNA probes [21]. It analyzes DNA structure, not the haemoglobin protein fractions themselves.</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Reticulocyte count (which can be measured by automated analysis) is a screening test used to assess the rate of red cell production (erythropoiesis) and is one of the initial tests to identify haemolysis, but it does not identify specific haemoglobin variants [22-24].</p>
                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> The single tube osmotic fragility test is a routine screening method for assessing red cell resistance to haemolysis, characteristic of thalassaemia traits (where red cells are more resistant), and is often used in smaller routine laboratories lacking automated analyzers [25]. It is not a method for identifying abnormal haemoglobin types (HbS, HbC, etc.).</p>

            <div class="clue" id="clue-4">
                <strong>Clue:</strong> This technique amplifies specific target sequences (like unique gene rearrangements or fusion products such as BCR-ABL) and is critical for risk stratification and individualized treatment plans post-remission induction [26-28].
            </div>
            <div class="explanation" id="explanation-4">
                <strong>Correct Answer: D. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based techniques (e.g., RT-PCR) [26, 28-30].</strong>
                <p><strong>Why D is correct:</strong> **PCR-based techniques (including RT-PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR)** are highly sensitive, capable of detecting MRD at a level of **$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$** (1 leukemic cell in 10,000–100,000 healthy cells). This sensitivity allows for assessment of initial response, prognosis, and risk categorization, enabling further individualized treatment [26-28].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Conventional Morphology, using Romanowsky-stained smears, defines complete remission (CR) as the presence of less than 5% blast cells in the marrow. This method is considered **conventional** and cannot detect the submicroscopic persistence of disease that leads to relapse [27].</p>
                <p><strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> Immunophenotyping by Flow Cytometry is used for MRD detection, particularly involving the enumeration of aberrant cell surface markers [27, 31]. However, while crucial for diagnosis, its practical limit of detection for MRD is typically lower (less sensitive) than highly optimized PCR methods, especially when needing to reach the $10^{-5}$ level [26].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping) examines chromosomal structure and is essential for diagnosis and prognosis determination in acute leukemia [14, 30, 32]. While it can detect large chromosomal abnormalities, its sensitivity is far too low for measuring residual disease at the micro-level required for MRD monitoring [26, 27].</p>

                <strong>Clue:</strong> This technology assists laboratory technologists but expert review remains necessary for complex cases with atypical cells, and they are less effective when analyzing non-peripheral blood specimens [33, 35, 36].
            </div>
            <div class="explanation" id="explanation-5">
                <strong>Correct Answer: B. DM analyzers rely heavily on AI/ML to pre-classify cells and standardize analysis, but their accuracy can be compromised by poor quality blood films [33].</strong>
                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> DM analyzers use digital imaging and AI/Machine Learning (ML) to pre-classify cells and enhance efficiency and standardization [33, 37]. However, the quality of the blood film and staining techniques **significantly influence the accuracy** of DM analyzers, and poor-quality samples may lead to errors [33]. An expert review remains essential for complex cases [33].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> DM analyzers complement the traditional microscopic examination, but the latter is still considered the **gold standard** [35]. DM analyzers have not yet replaced manual review entirely, especially in complex cases, due to algorithmic variability in recognizing rare or dysplastic cells [33].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> DM analyzers for **Bone Marrow (BM) aspirate** assessment have yet to be widely adopted, and they are currently **less effective** for BM aspirate examination due to higher complexity and lack of standardized sample preparation compared with Peripheral Blood (PB) smears [33, 36]. The manual BM examination remains the gold standard for investigating many hematological diseases [36, 38].</p>
                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Automated wedge smear preparation methods may generate artifacts due to mechanical trauma to cells (e.g., hypo-granularity of neutrophils or pseudopods on lymphocytes), and these artifacts can mimic the morphological manifestations of dysplasia (Myelodysplastic Syndrome), thus influencing DM analyzer performance negatively [39].</p>

                <strong>Correct Answer: B. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).</strong>
                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> **HPLC** is an automated technique where haemoglobins are adsorbed onto a column matrix and eluted by altering pH and ionic strength. This method is highly suited for neonatal screening and has **largely replaced haemoglobin electrophoresis** for the identification and quantification of haemoglobin variants and HbA2/HbF levels [1-3].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Citrate agar electrophoresis at acid pH (6.0) is a secondary procedure, useful for **further characterisation** of variants (like HbS, HbD, HbG, HbC, HbE) that have identical migration on cellulose acetate electrophoresis at alkaline pH [3, 4].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> The Acid Elution Test (Kleihauer-Betke test) assesses the cellular distribution of HbF [5]. The Betke method (alkali denaturation test) is used to **quantitate HbF** levels (typically 2-40%) [5, 6].</p>

                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> **RT-PCR** (specifically quantitative PCR or **qPCR**) is one of the two most sensitive diagnostic tests for CML and is the primary technique used to monitor response to TKI therapy by measuring the $BCR-ABL1$ mRNA transcript numbers [12-15]. Response criteria, such as Major Molecular Response (MMR), are defined by the $BCR-ABL1/ABL1$ ratio [11].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Conventional cytogenetics detects the **Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome** in metaphase preparations and is essential for diagnosis [12, 16]. However, RT-PCR is **more sensitive** for detecting the fusion gene and monitoring MRD, especially after a Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) has been achieved [12, 14, 17].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> Flow Cytometric Immunophenotyping (FACS) is used to detect MRD based on **leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes** [17, 18].

                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Microscopic examination (morphology) can define complete remission as $<5\%$ blast cells, but it is a conventional method and cannot detect the **submicroscopic persistence of disease** required for effective MRD monitoring [19].</p>

            <div class="explanation" id="explanation-9">
                <strong>Correct Answer: B. Eosin 5′-maleimide (EMA) binding test.</strong>
                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> The **EMA binding test** is a **rapid flow cytometric screening test** where the fluorescent dye EMA binds to erythrocyte transmembrane proteins (like Band 3). HS patients exhibit **decreased fluorescence** due to the membrane defects [7, 8, 24]. This test offers high sensitivity and specificity and is used alongside or sometimes in preference to the osmotic fragility test [24, 27].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> The standard osmotic fragility test measures the premature lysis of red cells in hypotonic solutions [7]. **Incubation of cells for 24 hours** prior to measurement improves sensitivity but this remains a traditional test that **does not distinguish HS** from other conditions with secondary spherocytes [7].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> The Acidified Glycerol Lysis Test (AGLT) is an indirect test for HS, conceptually similar to the osmotic fragility test, but has been noted to exhibit lower sensitivity than the EMA test [7, 24].</p>

                <strong>Clue:</strong> This test identifies a specific single-nucleotide substitution in the coagulation factor gene that makes the factor resistant to inactivation.

            <div class="explanation" id="explanation-10">
                <strong>Correct Answer: B. DNA-based assays targeting the Factor V Leiden mutation.</strong>
                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> APC resistance is most commonly caused by the **Factor V Leiden mutation** [31]. While APC resistance can be identified by special coagulation assays (screening), **DNA-based assays provide confirmation** for positive coagulation tests and are crucial to distinguish between homozygotes and heterozygotes, which affects thrombotic risk assessment [31, 32].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Antithrombin functional assays detect Antithrombin deficiency (Type I or Type II defect), which is another form of inherited thrombophilia, but unrelated to Factor V Leiden specifically [33, 34].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> The dRVVT (dilute Russell’s viper venom time) screening test, along with mixing and confirmatory steps, is used to detect the **Lupus Anticoagulant** (a phospholipid-dependent inhibitor), which is an acquired thrombotic risk factor, not an inherited coagulation factor mutation [35-37].</p>
                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> Fibrinogen concentration, typically measured by the Clauss assay, assesses the functionality of the common coagulation pathway and is important in diagnosing conditions like DIC or dysfibrinogenaemia [38-40].</p>

                <strong>Correct Answer: C. The decreased red cell mass (dilutional effect).</strong>
                <p><strong>Why C is correct:</strong> The corrected reticulocyte percent calculation, which is the first step in finding the Reticulocyte Index, uses the formula: observed reticulocyte percent $\times$ (observed red cell count/normal red cell count). This **adjustment corrects the percentage of reticulocytes for the decreased red cells in an anemic person**—accounting for the fact that even a normal number of reticulocytes will appear falsely elevated as a percentage in an anemic patient [21]. The overall Reticulocyte Index provides the **incidence** of new red cells released per day [21].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> Iron deficiency is a cause of low reticulocytes, but the index calculation itself corrects for the anemia [21].</p>
                <p><strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> While the full Reticulocyte Production Index *does* account for premature release and extended maturation time in peripheral blood (shift correction factor), the initial step (corrected reticulocyte percent) corrects only for the decreased red cell mass (dilution) [21, 22]. Option C describes the purpose of the initial correction step mentioned explicitly in the text, which addresses the prevalence of reticulocytes due to anemia [21].</p>

                <p><strong>Correct Answer: C. Cytogenetic Risk Group (Karyotype).</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Why C is correct:</strong> The IPSS-R relies on five parameters. The **Cytogenetic Risk Group** uses the most detailed stratification: Very Good, Good, Intermediate, Poor, and Very Poor (5 categories), giving it the highest weight in determining the overall risk score [2]. Cytogenetic analysis is necessary for prognosis and to guide management, such as screening for $TP53$ clones [66, 67].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A, B, and D are wrong:</strong> ANC, Hemoglobin, and Marrow blast percentage are also parameters in IPSS-R, but they are generally grouped into fewer scoring categories (2 to 4 categories each) [2].

                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> TTP is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia, so a normal or high platelet count at presentation would contradict the diagnosis, and platelet count normalization ($>150 \times 10^9$/L) defines clinical remission [2].</p>

                <p><strong>Correct Answer: C. DM analyzers count substantially fewer cells than required for an accurate differential.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Why C is correct:</strong> In **severe leukopenia samples**, the cell counts per slide and total cells counted were found to be two-fold and four-fold lower, respectively, when using the DI-60 analysis compared with manual counting (e.g., 91 total cells counted vs. 379 manually) [29]. The shorter TAT (turnaround time) in severe leukopenia for the DI-60 implies it does not spend adequate time searching for and counting cells [29].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> While misclassification occurs, the primary severe issue cited with leukopenia is the dramatically reduced count quantity [29].</p>
                <p><strong>Why B is wrong:</strong> On the contrary, the TAT for the DI-60 **decreases** in severe leukopenia because it stops counting prematurely. Manual counting TAT increases because the expert spends more time searching for sparse cells [29].</p>
                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> While true for many DM analyzers [30], this is a general limitation, whereas the dramatically reduced count quantity is specific to severe leukopenia [29].</p>

                <p><strong>Correct Answer: B. A nodal mass of $\geq 10 \text{ cm}$ or greater than one-third of the transthoracic diameter.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Why B is correct:</strong> Bulky disease is defined as a **nodal mass of $\geq 10 \text{ cm}$, or greater than one-third of the transthoracic diameter** at any level of thoracic vertebrae as determined by CT imaging [72].</p>
                <p><strong>Why A is wrong:</strong> $5 \text{ cm}$ is too small to meet the "bulky" criterion [72].</p>
                <p><strong>Why C is wrong:</strong> This criterion defines Ann Arbor **Stage III** involvement [72].</p>
                <p><strong>Why D is wrong:</strong> This criterion defines Ann Arbor **Stage IV** involvement [72].</p>
