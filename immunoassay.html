                <p>Immunoassay is a fascinating technique that allows us to detect and measure very specific substances in the blood, even when they are present in tiny amounts. The key to this technique is the use of antibodies, which are special proteins that can bind to a specific target molecule, much like a lock and key.</p>
                <p>In the laboratory, we use manufactured antibodies that are designed to target specific substances, such as hormones, vitamins, or drugs. By measuring how many of these antibodies bind to their target, we can determine the concentration of that substance in the patient's sample.</p>
                <p>Some of the tests we perform using immunoassay include:</p>

                    <li><strong>Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs):</strong> To check the health of the thyroid gland.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitamin D and B12 Levels:</strong> To check for deficiencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tumour Markers:</strong> To help diagnose and monitor certain types of cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapeutic Drug Monitoring:</strong> To ensure that patients are receiving the correct dose of their medication.</li>
