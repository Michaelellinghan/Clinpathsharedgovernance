    "description": "Shared Governance is a model of empowerment that gives staff a direct voice in the decisions that affect their working lives and the quality of patient care. It moves away from traditional top-down management, creating a partnership between frontline staff and leadership.\n\nThrough councils like ours, team members can take ownership of clinical practice, shape policies, and drive improvements from the ground up. We are proud to be the first non-patient-facing, Pathology-specific Shared Governance Council in the UK, pioneering this approach to enhance our services and empower our dedicated scientific and support staff."
