            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 text-center">The Two Paths to a Safe Transfusion</h2>
            <p class="text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center mb-8">Once a patient's blood group is known and their antibody screen is complete, we perform a final compatibility test between the patient and the donor blood unit. This can be done in two ways: a modern, computer-based "Electronic Issue" or a traditional, hands-on "Serological Crossmatch". The path we take is strictly determined by the patient's history and test results to ensure maximum safety.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2"><i class="fas fa-desktop text-blue-500 mr-2"></i>Electronic Issue (EI)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Electronic Issue is a "virtual" crossmatch performed by our laboratory computer system. It is a safe and efficient method that allows us to get blood to patients quickly. However, a patient must meet strict criteria to be eligible.</p>
                    <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Eligibility Criteria:</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The patient must have a current negative antibody screen.</li>
                        <li>The patient must have no history of clinically significant antibodies.</li>
                        <li>The patient's blood group must be fully validated on our system, often from two separate samples taken at different times.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">If all rules are met, the computer allows us to select compatible units and release them.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2"><i class="fas fa-flask text-green-500 mr-2"></i>Full Serological Crossmatch</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">If a patient is not eligible for EI, we must perform a traditional "wet" crossmatch. This is a physical test to prove compatibility.</p>
                     <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">The Process:</h4>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>We mix a sample of the patient's plasma with red cells taken directly from the donor blood bag.</li>
                        <li>The mixture is incubated at 37Â°C in a special gel card.</li>
                        <li>After incubation, the card is centrifuged and examined for agglutination (clumping).</li>
                        <li><strong>No agglutination</strong> means the unit is compatible and safe to issue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Any agglutination</strong> indicates an incompatibility. The unit must not be issued, and further investigation is required.</li>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Final Release: Last Checks for Safety</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">Regardless of the crossmatch method used, a series of critical final checks must be completed before any blood component leaves the laboratory. This is the last chance to catch any potential errors.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>We check that the patient's details and blood group on the request form, our computer system, and the compatibility label are a perfect match.</li>
                <li>We confirm that all special requirements, such as irradiated or CMV negative blood, have been met.</li>
                <li>We visually inspect the blood bag for any leaks, clots, or unusual colour that could indicate bacterial contamination.</li>
                <li>Once all checks are complete, the unit is placed in a dedicated, temperature-controlled issue fridge, ready for collection.</li>
                <li>Staff collecting the blood must use the <strong>Blood360 electronic tracking system</strong>, often with a biometric fingerprint scan, to ensure only trained personnel can access the fridge and that the correct unit is matched to the correct patient at the point of collection.</li>
