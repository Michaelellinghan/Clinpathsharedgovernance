                    We are thrilled to share some fantastic progress on our project to create a calming green space for staff to relax and recuperate. Thanks to the funding we secured, the very first piece of our new garden furniture has arrived!

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">
                    A huge thank you to Natalia, Kim, and Oana for their hard work in building the new set. We hope everyone gets a chance to use it and enjoy the sun!
                </p>

                    This new addition wouldn't be possible without the initial groundwork and the generosity of our colleagues and local businesses.
